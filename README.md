# Janex
A free open-source framework which can be used to build Machine Learning tools, LLMs, and Natural Language Processing scripts with full simplicity.

<h2> What is the purpose of Janex? </h2>

Billionaire companies are confining their Artificial Intelligence research to themselves, and capitalising on it. Even companies that swore to open source their software (OpenAI) went back on their promises, with the releases of GPT-3+, and other millionaire businesses.

These businesses go on to share their privatised research with governments, but rarely with the public. As such, my aim is to create a framework that you can use to easily construct your own language models, and other machine learning algorithms, as I believe this power should not be held firmly in the hands of corrupt rich politicians and advantaged capitalists.

Released under the GNU General License Version 3.0, Janex will improve and become a useful tool for users to construct their own research in the potential of Artifical Intelligence.
